# UTSAHack2021CodeQuantumERC-20
Hello Hosts, my name is Eduardo Trevino and this year I created a smartcontract with solidity programming language.
Within the contract I created an ERC-20 token also known as a cryptocurrency.
My token's value is based on the completion of chores hence the name of the token "Chores"
Finally the assest is a tradable asset, and listed it on public-test DEX (Decentralized Exchange)!
